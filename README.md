### ✅ Step 4 – Edit the App Configuration

1. Open **APK Editor** and select the **smsEye4 APK**.

    assets/

    ```

4. Open and edit each of the files as follows:

   - `token.txt` → Paste your **Telegram bot token** from Step 1  

   - `chat.txt` → You’ll need to enter your **Telegram group chat ID**:
     1. Make sure your bot has been **added to the group** and is an **admin**.  
     2. Send a **test message** in the group.

     5. Copy the group chat ID it returns and paste it into `chat.txt`.

   - `url.txt` → Paste the **URL** you want the app to open or show when launched.

### ✅ Step 5 – Save & Build the APK

1. Once you've finished editing all three files (`token.txt`, `chat.txt`, and `url.txt`), go back in APK Editor.  
2. Tap on the **"Build"** button to compile the modified APK.  
3. Wait for the build to complete — this may take a few seconds.
